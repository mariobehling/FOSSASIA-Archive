Package Pike 8.0 for all Linux distributions

The Pike Programming Language is nearing its 8.0 release.
Currently only Debian and Gentoo have Pike packages.

once you get Pike working, you can work on packaging sTeam. this project uses Pike.

In this project you should provide packages for all major Linux distributions.
starting with Fedora and openSUSE, but also others that don't have one yet.
an RPM spec file already exists, but it may need to be updated.

It is probably best to use the openSUSE build service, however care needs to be
taken that the resulting packages satisfy the various distributions
requirements for acceptance.
