your task is to explore and document the REST API for sTeam

you can find code examples in the [community calendar project]( https://gitlab.com/beijinglug/community-calendar ) and in the [techgrind website]( https://github.com/Tech-Grind/ng-techgrind )

you can also explore the [techgrind site]( http://ngtg.techgrind.asia:8000/ )

you do not need to document the whole API, but you should focus on the registration process, and submitting and updating documents.

parts of the documentation already exist here:
[https://gitlab.com/beijinglug/community-calendar/blob/master/api-documentation.md](https://gitlab.com/beijinglug/community-calendar/blob/master/api-documentation.md)

the documentation should be released under the GPLv2 or later, so that it can be included with the original code.
