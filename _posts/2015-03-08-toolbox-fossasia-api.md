FOSSASIA API is set of tools to gather information about Open Source Communities. All data should be hosted and maintained by the communities itself.

As of now we have a lot of tools we can work with:

* the Common Map, displaying the location and contact information of communities
* a feed aggregator, to aggregate all rss feeds
* a calendar collector as wordpress plugin
* display lifetime events of all communities

Goal of this project is to extend the toolbox, create new tools or enhance existing ones. Possible parts could be:

* Enhancements
	* community map: show latest news and events of communities on a map
	* filters: filter map by geolocation to receive news, events and other community related information only within a selected view
	* use the Metacommunity field to group communities, e.g. international organizations with local groups
* Extensions
	* extend FOSSASIA API specs to provide information about services (e.g. web service, mail servers, etc), see api.freifunk.net for inspiration
	* create a web service to get parts of API files, based on geo or content filters
	* build an overview about API files and validate them
* Visualization:
	* a framework to easily building charts of API data
	* Euler charts to display by countries, metacommunities, cities
	* Pie-Chart: how to contact communities (Facebook, Jabber, IRC, usw..)
	* list of services and their status
