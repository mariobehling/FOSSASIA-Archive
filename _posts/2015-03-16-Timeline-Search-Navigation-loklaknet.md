loklak is free software hosted on loklak.org which provides message search results from twitter in json format. loklak is a complete search engine back-end solution with a JSON api. What is missing to provide a search web page is a web page design showing the json search results as timeline in the style of a twitter search result. Basically it should look like https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=fossasia in the right column while the left column has to provided new/other search navigation tools. The data to be presented will all be within the json API of loklak. The timeline web page must also provide
- switching off the left navigation columns and switching on self-refreshing which turns the timeline into a twitterwall
- some kind of animation when selecting navigation options in the left column (i.e. fade-in and fade-out of select options)

The applicant should have the following skills
- advanced JavaScript skills
- proven ability (show an example of your work) to write AJAX web applications
- confident with bootstrap css
Nice to have
- backbone.js (usage of backbone.js is not a must be you may consider it)
- overall web design skills
