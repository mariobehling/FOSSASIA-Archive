Projects like Ayab and Knitic access knitting machines. The [AYAB](http://ayab-knitting.com) has already created a plugin system for knitting machines and implemented talking to Brother KH 910/930 models. The software is based on Python and QT.

The primary task is to develop a library based on this solution to add support for more machines.

If there's time left, create installation packages for Windows and Linux distributions.

Features:

* access the hardware directly
* emulate file formats
* use different hardware solutions e.g. Arduino
* installation is documented step-by-step
* installation is GUI based, too
* improve usability
* use standard installation procedures
* use knitting machine wording, e.g. green/orange to count needles
