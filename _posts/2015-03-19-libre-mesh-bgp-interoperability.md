title: Libre-Mesh BGP interoperability

desc: Libre-Mesh is the open source swiss army knife for mesh networks, it is very versatile but it lacks full BGP support in order to make it the tool of choice for already established community network members. With this proposal I would like to implement full BGP support in Libre-Mesh.

* Creation of a LiMe plug-in (in the form of an OpenWrt package) to auto configure a BGP daemon (possibly BIRD)
* Study interaction between BGP and dynamic routing protocols.
* Tune BGP and others routing protocol to inter-operate optimally
