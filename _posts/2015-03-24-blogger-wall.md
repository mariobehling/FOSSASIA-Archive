Before and after the FOSSASIA event happens many speakers/attendees share their experience about FOSSASIA in their personal blogs. Most of the times these blog posts didn't reach to large amount of audience because of one or another reason. The idea is to create a centralized space on FOSSASIA event website itself where people can submit link of their blog post, many people will be able to see them and we can keep track of such blog posts.

For this we will create APIs to submit, retrieve, update and remove blog post links. Front-end will load specified no. of posts on load and subsequent calls will be made to API to load more posts.

The applicant should have the following skills:

* advanced development skills on web development including python, Django, AngularJS/Jquery
* proven ability (show an example of your work) to write AJAX web applications
* confident with CSS, HTML
* overall application and web design skills
