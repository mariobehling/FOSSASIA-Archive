desc: ExpEYES Pocket Science Lab - Develop new Sensor Plug-ins and Add-on devices
status: open
mentors: Mario Behling, Hong Phuc
skill-level: High
skills: Python,Scipy,PyGTK, ATmega Microcontroller
category: Science Lab
---

The idea is to develop new Sensor Plug-ins to measure various parameters like Force, Pressure, Wind Speed, Barometric Pressure etc... and to enhance the scope of ExpEYES for using it to perform or develope several new experiments with reasonable accuracy using low-cost devices.
Add-on devices like low-cost temperature monitoring and control system with digital display and a stand alone data acquisition system for weather monitoring or environmental studies  can be developed.

The applicant should have the following skills:

* Python, PyGTK, Tkinter, Scipy
* ATmega microcontrollers for stand-alone add-on devices
