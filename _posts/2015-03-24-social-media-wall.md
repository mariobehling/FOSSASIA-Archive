During event people share things related to event on various social media platforms using #fossasia hashtag.
The ideas is to create a space where we can display content shared by attendees with particular hashtag.
This space should display archives from various social media platforms as long as reader is interested to read them.

Currently we are targeting to display content from Twitter and Facebook.

Required Skills:
