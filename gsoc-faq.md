**What should a proposal look like?**

First of all check the general answer in the [GSoC FAQ]( http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2015/help_page#5._What_should_a_student_proposal_look )

what we'd like to see from your proposal is, that you show that you understand
what the project is about.

describe what you believe needs to be done for the project in detail.  (this
may be done with general terms, since you are still learning the technology (eg
smalltalk), we won't expect you to already know the project specific terms).
make some drawings for how the user interface might look like.  list the
features that you believe need to be implemented. add your own ideas here.
apart from the requirements given in the project description, tell us what you
think should be added.

make a development plan. what tools and platform will you be using for development?
how will you spend the time over summer? decide which features are most
important, and which you can leave for later. also decide which features are
optional, so you can drop them if you run out of time. at the end we'd rather
see something working with just a few features, rather than lots of features
which are all incomplete.

describe what you believe you need to learn in order to implement these
features. if you can, list resources where you can learn what you need for this
feature. do this separately for each feature. (you don't need to cover all
features that way, just the most important ones)

what you can also include: show what you learned so far in preparation for the project.
tell us what you believe might cause difficulties.
tell us why you picked this project. after it is done, do you want to use the
project for yourself? how would you use it?

and any other things you think might be important or interesting.
